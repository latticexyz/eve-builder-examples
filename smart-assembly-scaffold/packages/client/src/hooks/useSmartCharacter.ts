 * `useSmartCharacter` hook
 *
 * This hook fetches information about a user based on whether their connected wallet address
 * is registered to a character ID in a MUD table. It retrieves data from two MUD tables:
 * 1. `CharactersByAddressTable` - Maps an address to a character ID.
 * 2. `EntityRecordOffchainTable` - Contains metadata for the character, such as its name.
 *
 * Note:
 * - Some fields, like ERC-20 token balances, are not fetched from MUD and must be queried
 *   separately (e.g., using the `balanceOf` function of the respective token's contract).
 * - This hook provides a foundation for creating SmartCharacter objects that can be expanded
 *   based on your needs.
